    <!--The sizes attribute tells the browser the size or sizes of the element the srcset is attached to
    so that the browser can use the appropriate image. In this case, we are telling the browser that
    the image will be displayed at 50% of the viewport width.

    For example, if the width of the browser screen is 900 pixels wide, then the image will be rendered at 450pixels.
    The browser will select kitten-small.png as it’s the smallest image that is still larger than the viewport width.-->
