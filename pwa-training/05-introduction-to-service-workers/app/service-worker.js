        //8) It is possible for a new service worker to activate immediately, even if an existing service
        //worker is present, by skipping the waiting phase.

    //We log a message here, but this event is often used to update caches.
    //Only one service worker can be active at a time for a given scope
    //so a newly installed service worker isn't activated until the existing service
    //worker is no longer in use.

    //worker). Observe the logged events.

    //re-activate the service worker. Service workers also persist across browsing sessions.

    //9) Intercept network requests
    //Service Workers can act as a proxy between your web app and the network.
    //The service worker receives a fetch event for every HTTP request made by the browser.
    //fetch event object contains the request; 
    //Listening for fetch events in the service worker is similar to listening to click events 
    //in the DOM.
    //when a fetch event occurs, we log the requested URL to the console.

        console.log('Fetching:', event.request.url);
